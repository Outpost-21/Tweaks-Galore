				<header>UI Overhaul</header>
				<text>The options screen for Tweaks Galore has been completely overhauled, the previous pages have been collected together in pages for vanilla and each separate DLC, with collapsable sections and a searchbar for finding specific tweaks easily. Most will probably only see this as a purely visual change, it's far from it though.</text>
			</li>
			<li>
				<header>Code Overhaul</header>
				<text>Tweaks have now been converted into defs so anyone can use this system to very easily add tweaks for their own mods, new tweaks, pages and sections can be added very easily with just XML, and values given in-game can be used to replace values in XML using new types of PatchOperations. For more info click the GitHub link at the top of the update.
					
Old settings should still be set up how they were, I attempted to make sure they were migrated over to the new system in place automatically when you loaded up the game the first time after this update.</text>
