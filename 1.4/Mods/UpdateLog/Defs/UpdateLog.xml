		<content>Version 2.0.xxxx
Added support for 1.4  started adding tweaks related to Biotech. Note that a lot of changes have happened with 1.4 and the DLC, so some tweaks may not work properly, remember to report those issues so they can be fixed (and include a HugsLib log!).

Some tweaks may need further updates in cases where compatibility with other mods is concerned, this will come as those update.</content>
