		<content>Royal Pain? No more!

New Tweaks:
- [Royalty] Allow Altars in Throne Rooms - Does what it says, allows altars while keeping a throne room recognised as one.
- [Royalty] Allow Any Building in Throne Rooms - Again does what it says, just removes any building restrictions, including altars.
- [Royalty] Wait, This is Better - Allows higher tier royalty gear to also satisfy lower tier seeking titles.
- [Royalty] No Trading Permit - Removes the need for a trading permit to be able to trade with the Shattered Empire.
- [Royalty] Royal Titles - New page allowing control over some aspects of every Royal Title the player can obtain, including modded titles (yes it works with Vanilla Factions Expanded - Empire, it's why I did this whole update).
- [Royalty] Royal Permits - New page allowing control over some aspects of Royal Permits, including modded ones.

Fixes:
- [Royalty] No Backstory Limits - Should now work with Vanilla Psycasts Expanded, also removing backstory limits on psycasting paths.</content>
