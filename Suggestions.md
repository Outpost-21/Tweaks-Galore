### Better Pyromania
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2624048970
Author: Aelanna
Summary: Overhauls Pyromania to be a sustainable need that makes it less tempting to just finish off any surviving raider with that stupid fucking trait.
Decision: Yes. A lot of work to recreate, would be preferable to just get permission to include directly.

### LightsOut
Original:https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2584269293
Author: juanlopez2008
Summary: Turns off lights and workbenches when not in use, like when no pawns are in the room.
Decision: Yes. There's no License and recreating it wouldn't be ideal so better to get permission to include directly if possible.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1508341791
Author: FrozenSnowFox
Summary: Filth gets washed away with rain and fades over time.

### Animals Are Fun
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2108362126

### Haul To Stack
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=949498803
Author: ItsComcastic
Summary: Haulers prioritize hauling to an existing stack even when multiple pawns are hauling.

Author: Mehni/Uuugggg
Summary: Colonists gather to inventory then haul to stockpile, inestad of going back and forth for multiple stacks.
Decision: No. Same reasoning as Haul To Stack.

### Quality Builder
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=754637870
Author: Hatti/shadwar
Summary: Ensures buildings that have quality are only built by the best builder so they're the best chance of being the highest possible quality.
Decision: Yes, maybe. It's more complex than a standard tweak since it has UI elements.

### Replace Stuff
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1372003680
Author: Uuugggg
Summary: Lets you just replace stuff instead of deconstructing/mining/bridging first and handles those things appropriately.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1356838246

Author: Charlotte
Summary: Adds a bench to mend stuff or recycle them.
Decision: No, fuck no, it adds a whole ass bench, why would I add that to a tweaks mod?

Author: tammybee
Summary: Human re-equip the weapon that equiped before downed when recovering from downed (or fully healing).

### Mass Graves
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1542386771
Author: pyrce

Author: Frozen Snow Fox
Summary: Splits the work tab up much more, allowing more complex prioritization.

### Smarter Construction
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2202185773
Author: Hultis
Summary: Stop your pawns from constantly building themselves into a wall or blocking something that hasn't been built yet. Great for filling sapper tunnels and rebuilding walls.
Decision: Great mod, overhauls a large mechanic in the game though, way too much to recreate and no license so can't just pull it in.

### Subsurface Conduit
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1609226728
Author: Murmur
Summary: Underground power conduits.
Decision: Again this adds a building, what is wrong with you lot?

Decision: Get the fuck out.

### [Kit] Graze up
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2302739121
Author: Kittah Khan
Summary: In summary, chickens no longer clear out a pasture in three seconds flat, you can cycle through pastures and your animals can find grass that's been snowed under, your dreams of a reindeer colony can finally come true.
Decision: Maybe.

### Everybody Buys Slaves
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2799461327
Author: bblkepling
Summary: Patches all traders that don't buy or sell slaves to be able to buy them.

### Use Your Gun!
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1712993896

Author: velcroboy333

Decision: Yep, seems fair since I also included a stonecutting speed stat.

### Cleaning Speed
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2748222814
Author: Aelanna
Summary: Adds a cleaning speed stat and two traits that affect it.
Decision: Cleaning speed is a stat in vanilla in 1.4, a tweak instead affecting a multiplier on it would make more sense now.

### Vanilla Fix: Haul After Slaughter
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2801452324
Author: pureMJ
Summary: Colonist will now haul the corpse after slaughtering an tamed animal.
Decision: Yep, simple enough patch tweak.

### Wild Animal Sex + Behaviors
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1224175982
Author: WalkingProblem
Summary: Lets them animals fuck but has a bunch of other shit too.
Decision: Partial yes. Letting wild animals fuck, absolutely, including a blacklist for specific animals to not with certain ones excluded by default (boomrats). Lots of other shit absolutely unneccesary will not be included. I'd also add a limit cap for wild animals so they don't lag the fuck out of the game.

### Deconstruct First
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1567338829
Author: Fozzy

Summary: Inside the Cooking Worktab the Pawns will Butcher First, then proceed to cook the meals
Decision: Yep, fine.

### RepairLast
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2373014222
Author: Fozzy
Summary: sets the inworktypepriority on 55 - meaning reparing walls and furniture comes last but before smoothing walls and floors. Ur Pawns will construct and deconstruct before repairing.
Decision: Yep yep.

### Collars Aren't Clothes!
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2620383977
Author: Anthony
Summary: No longer counts slave collars as clothing. Fixes the 'wore/wearing clothes' mood debuff a slave collar gives to a Nudist and/or Fully Nude precept Ideoligion follower.

Author: Space Moth
Summary: This mod will make guests and traders listen to forbidden doors as long as the faction relations are above -20.
Decision: Sure, maybe.

### Dynamic Population
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1658712035
Author: sewer rat
Summary: Finer control of population settings - without editing defs!
Decision: Yep, sure.

### Dynamic Carrying Capacity
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2745456953
Author: YemG
Summary: Changes mass capacity for pawns, like the other dozen or so mods that do the same.
Decision: Hard pass. It's a tweak but it's a pain in the ass compatibility wise.

### Grass Is Still Hay
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2193891816
Author: elky
Summary: Cutting grass or bushes gives you resources: Grass and High grass - 2xHay, Bushes - 2xWood

### Hay doesn't need Cooling!
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2363788115
Author: ivelischt

Decision: Sure, makes more sense than vanilla.

### I Clearly Have Enough!
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2023661266
Author: ChippedChaps 
Summary: This mod makes the resource readout when placing blueprints count all resources on the map. This is so that it won't complain even when you can see that you clearly have enough on the map.

Decision: Yep.

### OgreStack
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1447140290
Author: Ogre
Summary: Same as Stack XXL (this is the better of the two imo)
Decision: Yep, need a better option than both. They both have issues with typically unstackable items becoming stackable just because of the category.

### Realistic Rooms Rewritten
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2558042766
Author: Lucifer
Summary: This mod lowers the required space for each tier of room size (cramped, rather tight, etc.).

Author: Kathanon
Summary: Makes pawns not stand outside their allowed area to interact with something that is within it.

Summary: Adds options to X then Y with prisoners.
Decision: Sure.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2011655761
Author: Alias
Summary: Splits up some work to how it used to be before 1.1.

### Build From Inventory
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1691419062
Author: Uuugggg
Summary: Construction will use things in your colonist or pack animal's inventory.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2559760431
Author: Crentist
Summary: This mod changes the part that some apparel covers to better reflect what they cover, so you can combine items.
Decision: Too specific, patches things manually and there's far too much to handle for this to be worthwhile, since rendering always makes it look stupid too I'm not inclined to waste my time on this.

### Middle Layer Slave Strap
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2603576823
Author: eBlair
Summary: Moves the slave strap apparel to the middle slot.
Decision: Sure, it's just one patch at least.

### Drop All Inventory

Author: Captain Muscles

Author: SirMashedPotato
Summary: A simple patch that removes the food poisoning chance from insect jelly.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2725963995
Author: Sea

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2796436183
Author: Morphium
Summary: Bodies will no longer be crushed into nothingness by falling rocks but can be recovered by mining the chunk. Nothing more to say about it.
Decision: It makes sense but the license doesn't allow just using the code and I don't want to recreate it poorly.

### Prisoners Are Not Swines
Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2613966365
Author: Hate me
Summary: This mod adds custom cleaning behaviour to prisoners, so instead of just idling around they will clean their cells.

Author: LVLVbNH
Summary: Simple mod that untied specialist roles from memes. Allows player choose any two specialist role for custom ideology without dev mod enabled.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1339148170

Author: purpleyam
Summary: A tiny little patch to unlock the "minor" and "heavy" scarification precepts for ideologies without the Pain Is Virtue meme (unless you have Flesh Purity)

Author: Jaxe
Summary: This minipatch disables the generation of ruined walls, floors and objects on your generated maps.

Author: ApocalypsePal
Summary: Disables playing the vanilla music clips while playing in maps.

Original: https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=2231840984
Author: Kiame Vivacity
Summary: Displays ticks per second info to the in-game display.

Author: Casiy
Summary: Makes production benches capable of being made from stone.
